It lazily fetches more objects from the database server. (Note that you have to create a new cursor if you want to start from the beginning.)

# @topic category functions/Database
# Here you can find the functions to access the polymake database.

# @topic category functions/Database Admin
# These are administrative functions. You need admin access to the database for these.
# 
# This category also contains functions that I want to hide from the public because they are not yet completely presentable.


# @topic category functions/Database Write Access
# These are the functions to insert and update objects. You need write access to the database for these.
