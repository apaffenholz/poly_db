This file documents the steps I performed on the polymake server in order to get the database running.

* Install MongoDB
	- Download and move everything into /usr/local/bin

* Install pymongo (Python module):
	sudo easy_install pymongo

* Set up a config file /etc/mongodb.conf:

	fork = true		(needed to run mongodb as deamon)
	port = 27017
	quiet = true
	dbpath = /polymake/mongodb	(here all data will be stored)
	logpath = /polymake/mongodb/log/mongod.log	(logfile)
	logappend = true	(do not overwrite existing logfile)
	journal = true
	auth = true

* A second config file for easier administration and data insertion:

	fork = true		(needed to run mongodb as deamon)
	bind_ip = 127.0.0.1
	port = 27017
	quiet = true
	dbpath = /polymake/mongodb	(here all data will be stored)
	logpath = /polymake/mongodb/log/mongod.log	(logfile)
	logappend = true	(do not overwrite existing logfile)
	journal = true



* Make sure the folder /polymake/mongodb and everything below belongs to polytrac

* Start Mongo Deamon (as polytrac):
	mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

* Insert data using xml2db.py. (This takes input a list of polymake files -- currently it prints processing time.) -- Currently everything goes into pm.lattice_polys.

* open up port 27017 
	- on polymake server at TUD we have to edit Holger's firewall settings

* authentication
	- useradmin with roles: userAdminAnyDatabase (manages users, MongoDB superuser)
	- admin with roles: dbAdminAnyDatabase, readWriteAnyDatabase, clusterAdmin
	- polymake with roles: read (user for everyone may only read pm database)


TODOs:

* discuss database structure
* preprocess polymake files (compute missing props)
* indexing

* web interface
