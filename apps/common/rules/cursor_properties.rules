# These are basic properties of the DatabaseCursor. In this category you find everything you need to access the polymake database.

# These are properties of the DatabaseCursor that are needed if you want to access some other database server. (Note that some things may not be implemented yet.)

# @topic category objects/DatabaseCursor/properties/Internal
# These properties are computed automatically and only for internal use. You can safely ignore them.
