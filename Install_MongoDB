This file explains how you can locally install the perl driver for MongoDB using cpan.

First you might need to remove the .cpan folder in your home directory.

Now insert the following lines into your .bashrc (or .profile or ...). (Note that you should adapt the path in the first line to your needs.)

MYCPANSTUFF=/some/path/for/cpan/stuff
export PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT="$PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT:$MYCPANSTUFF";
export PERL_MB_OPT="--install_base $MYCPANSTUFF";
export PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=$MYCPANSTUFF";
export PERL5LIB="$MYCPANSTUFF/lib/perl5:$PERL5LIB";
export PATH="$MYCPANSTUFF/bin:$PATH";

Now start cpan (answer "yes" everywhere) and enter the following lines:
o conf build_dir "/tmp/cpanstuff"
o conf commit
install CPAN
reload cpan
install Params::Validate

Restart cpan and enter:
install MongoDB
